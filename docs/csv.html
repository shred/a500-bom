<h1>Mouser CSV Export</h1>
<p>For your convenience, we offer a CSV export of the parts that are available at <a href="https://www.mouser.com">Mouser Electronics</a>.</p>
<p>Copy the CSV below to your clipboard, and paste it into a text editor or spreadsheet tool. There you can modify the CSV, change quantities or remove parts that you already have. After that, <a href="https://www.mouser.com/Bom/Upload">upload the CSV</a> to create a Bill of Material in your customer account. The original Commodore part numbers are retained, so you will find them printed on the component bags later.</p>
<h2>Before You Start…</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have you gathered the <span class="rare">Rare</span> parts already?</strong> The parts on this list will be useless without them.</li>
<li><strong>This list is not complete!</strong> It only contains the standard components that are sold by Mouser Electronics. You will have to find other sources for the rest. We cannot assist you there.</li>
<li><strong>Do not blindly order this list, but scrutinize every part first!</strong> Even though the choice of parts <em>should</em> be correct, they have not been proven yet to actually work on an assembled Amiga board.</li>
<li><strong>The choice of parts is only meant to be an example.</strong> There may cheaper or better suited alternatives.</li>
<li><strong>Mind the graduated prices.</strong> The quantities in this list are the exact amounts needed to assemble the board. Ordering larger quantities may be cheaper. It&rsquo;s also good to have a few parts as spare.</li>
<li><strong>Some parts are replacements</strong> because the original parts have been discontinued. They do not meet the original specifications and thus may cause problems.</li>
<li><strong>Some parts are optional.</strong> Check if you need them.</li>
</ul>
